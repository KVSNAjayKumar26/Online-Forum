1. Core Components
Thread List Component: Displays a list of all available threads.
Thread Component: Each individual thread that shows replies and other details.
Reply Component: Displays replies within a thread.
User Profile Component: Displays user information like avatar, username, bio, etc.
New Thread/Reply Form: Allows users to post new threads or reply to existing threads.
2. Styling (Color Themes & Animations)
Material-UI/Styled Components: You can use @mui/material or styled-components for a professional look with built-in themes and responsive design.
CSS Animations/Framer Motion: You can use CSS keyframes or libraries like Framer Motion for smooth animations (e.g., thread opening animations, reply form transitions, hover effects).
3. Responsive Design
Flexbox/Grid Layout: Use Flexbox or CSS Grid for a responsive layout. Make sure components adjust to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Breakpoints: Use media queries or Material-UIâ€™s responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes.
4. Routing
React Router: Use React Router for navigation between different parts of the forum (e.g., viewing a list of threads, opening a specific thread, viewing user profiles).
5. State Management
Redux/Context API: For managing global state (like user data, threads, replies), use Redux or React's Context API to handle complex state across the app.
6. Authentication
Implement user authentication (e.g., login, registration) with services like Firebase or a custom backend. Store user profiles and allow users to manage their profiles.
